# Stroke-Prediction-EDA-Task-_-SHAI-b-2022
EDA assignment on Stroke Prediction Dataset, which is a task assigned to me as part of my training at SHAI AI training b-2022.

ðŸ§© Dataset:

Stroke Prediction on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/code?resource=download

The dataset contains 5110 records, and has 12 cols.


ðŸ§© Findings:

â™¦ The data is imbalanced and most of the cols/attributes aren't distributed normally, mostly skewed.

â™¦ Most stroke cases are found in individuals that have neither Heart Diseases nor Hypertension.

â™¦ Individuals with strokes have mostly Overweight or moderetly obese BMI.

â™¦ Individuals with strokes are mostly older individuals over 60.

â™¦ Individuals who have a stroke are mostly married; and most married people are over 30.

â™¦ Individuals with avg_glucose_level over 100 mostly have a stroke.

â™¦ Gender and a couple of other attributes have no effect/correlation to having a stroke.

â™¦ The analysis that can be done on this dataset is far from complete, but because this is a timed task on a tight schedule I focused on the main requirments of it.
